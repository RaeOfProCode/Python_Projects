# Portfolio: Python Projects

# Etch-A-Sketch GameEtch-A-Sketch Game
Mar 2024
- Developed Etch-A-Sketch Game replicating the classic toy's functionality in Python.
- Utilized "A" and "D" keys to rotate the arrow and "W" key to draw lines, mimicking the toy's knobs.
- Enabled users to draw freely, similar to the Etch-A-Sketch experience.

# Pong GamePong Game
Feb 2024
- The Pong Game replicates the classic table tennis experience. 
- In this two-player game, the first user controls a paddle with the up and down arrow keys, while the second user maneuvers their paddle using the "W" and "S" keys. The objective is to hit the ball back and forth between the players' paddles. 
-The game introduces an exciting challenge as players strive to prevent the ball from passing behind their respective paddles, and a miscalculated move results in the game's conclusion.

# Snake GameSnake Game
Feb 2024
- The Snake Game stimulates the iconic snake game experience.
- In the Snake Game, the player controls a snake using the arrow keys, navigating it to consume randomly appearing dots that increase the snake's size. The challenge arises as players must avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the walls.

# Turtle Crossing GameTurtle Crossing Game
Feb 2024
- In this engaging project, players take on the role of a turtle with the objective of reaching the top while skillfully navigating through moving blocks of cars using the up arrow key for movement. 
- Upon successfully reaching the summit, players earn scores and are then challenged to descend amidst faster-moving cars. The game dynamically intensifies as players accumulate more scores, with the speed of the cars escalating for an increasingly challenging experience.

# Turtle Drawing (turtle_project.py)
April 2024
- Developed as a project for COMP 110.
- Description: This is a scene of an apartment building at night, which took inspiration from the image, "Apartment building at night," created by finwal89. The scene includes the apartment windows; however, I wanted to create a dynamic scene so, I've implemented a random background and random placement of window blinds to better show the "reality" behind the scene as the windows of an apartment are not static but are occassionally closed or may differ in color. As you "Run" the program, you'd notice that the scene is always changing, much like it would in reality. In addition, in order to meet the "recursion" requirement and add more to the scene, multiple recursive trees are shown in the scene. Below is the code for the scene (multiple comments are placed that describe what is being done).
